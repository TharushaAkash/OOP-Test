### ❓ Question: Can You Manage a Student List in Java Using Only `add()` and `remove()`?

Create a simple **Student Management System** in Java using an `ArrayList<Student>`. You are only allowed to use the following `ArrayList` methods:

- `add()`
- `remove(Object)`

❗ **Do NOT use** `contains()`, `get()`, `set()`, `indexOf()`, or any other ArrayList methods.

#### 🧾 Task Instructions:

1. Define a class `Student` with the following fields:
   - `int id`
   - `String name`
   - `int age`

2. In your `main` method:
   - Create an `ArrayList<Student>`.
   - Get input from the user to add **3 students** to the list.
   - Prompt the user to enter an `id` of a student they want to delete.
   - Manually search through the list using a loop and **remove** the student with the matching ID using `remove()`.

3. After removal, print all remaining students.

### 🔒 Restrictions

- You **must not use**: `get()`, `set()`, `contains()`, `indexOf()`, or any kind of stream or lambda.
- You **can only use**: `add()` and `remove()`, along with loops and conditionals.

---

### 🧠 Hints

- You can use a `for-each` loop to find the student manually.
- Since you can't modify a list while iterating, you may need to use an `Iterator` or loop carefully.

**Can you remove a student by ID and update the list using only `add()` and `remove()`?**
