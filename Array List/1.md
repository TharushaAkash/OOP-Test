### ‚ùì Question: How Can You Use an ArrayList to Store and Display Student Information in Java?

Create a class named `Student` in Java that includes the following fields:

- `int id`
- `String name`
- `int age`

- `public void displayDetails()`

Then, perform the following tasks:

1. Create an `ArrayList` to store objects of the `Student` class.
2. Take input from the user for **3 students** (id, name, and age for each).
3. Add each student to the `ArrayList`.
4. Display all student information after all inputs have been collected.

Use the `Scanner` class for input and `ArrayList` for dynamic storage.
