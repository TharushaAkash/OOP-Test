### ❓ Question: Can You Build a Robust Student Management System with Exception Handling and OOP in Java?

You are tasked with developing a **Student Management System** that uses:

- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✅ `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage
- ✅ Exception Handling for input validation and runtime errors

---

### 📋 Requirements

1. **Create a class `Student`** with:
   - `int id`
   - `String name`
   - `int age`

2. In the `main` method (or a separate class if preferred):
   - Create an `ArrayList<Student>` to hold student records.
   - Prompt the user to enter details for 3 students.
   - Use `try-catch` blocks to:
     - Catch `InputMismatchException` if the user enters invalid data (e.g., letters for age).
     - Throw and catch a **custom exception** if the age is less than 5 or greater than 100.
   - After successful entry, add the students to the list.

3. Finally, display all valid students.

### 🔧 Additional Rules

- You must define and use a **custom exception class** named `InvalidAgeException`.
- Do not allow the program to crash on bad input — use `Scanner` and loop until valid data is entered.
- You may structure the code using OOP principles (e.g., `StudentManager` class).
