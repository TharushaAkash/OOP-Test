### ðŸ§ª Java Interface Coding Question

Create an interface called `Printable` with a method `printDetails()`.

Then, create two classes:
- `Book` â€“ with `title` and `author`
- `Invoice` â€“ with `invoiceNumber` and `amount`

Both classes should implement the `Printable` interface and override `printDetails()` to display their own details.

Finally, write a `Main` class where you:
1. Create an array of `Printable` objects.
2. Add both `Book` and `Invoice` objects to the array.
3. Loop through the array and call `printDetails()` on each.
