Develop a **Vehicle Rental System** where a `Customer` class maintains references to the `Vehicle` objects they have rented, but the `Vehicle` class does not maintain any reference to the `Customer`.

Use **inheritance** where `Vehicle` is a superclass and `Car`, `Motorbike` are subclasses.

**Requirements:**
- `Vehicle` class: attributes `vehicleID` (String), `brand` (String)
  - Constructor to initialize attributes
  - Method `displayVehicleDetails()`
- `Car` class (inherits from `Vehicle`): additional attribute `numDoors` (int)
- `Motorbike` class (inherits from `Vehicle`): additional attribute `engineCapacity` (double)

- `Customer` class:
  - Attributes: `customerID` (String), `customerName` (String)
  - A fixed-size array of `Vehicle` objects (size 2)
  - Method `rentVehicle(Vehicle v)`
  - Method `displayCustomerDetails()` (displays customer info and details of rented vehicles)

- `VehicleRentalApp` class (with `main` method):
  - Create instances of `Car` and `Motorbike`
  - Create a `Customer` object
  - Rent both vehicles and display all details
