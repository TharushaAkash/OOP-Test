# 🚗 Story: Car Rental System

In a car rental company, **Managers** and **Assistants** work to handle car reservations and maintenance. The company also owns a collection of **Cars**.  
The system requires a Java program that models these entities using **bi-directional association**, **inheritance**, **method overriding**, **aggregation**, and **dynamic updates** of worker and car statuses.

---

# 🎯 Classes and Their Responsibilities

Design a Java program demonstrating **bi-directional association** between a **RentalCompany** and its **Worker**, and between a **RentalCompany** and its **Car**.  
The program must also showcase **inheritance**, **aggregation**, and **method overriding**.

---

## 1. Worker (Base Class)
- **Attributes:**
  - `int id`
  - `String name`
  - `RentalCompany company`  
    (reference back to RentalCompany — "many → one" association)
- **Constructor:**  
  `Worker(int id, String name)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void setCompany(RentalCompany company)`  
    → assigns the company
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    → to be *overridden* by subclasses; should print name and assigned company's name if set

---

## 2. Manager (Subclass of Worker)
- **Adds:**
  - `String department`
- **Constructor:**  
  `Manager(int id, String name, String department)`
- **Overrides:**
  - `displayInfo()` → prints ID, name, department, and company name

---

## 3. Assistant (Subclass of Worker)
- **Adds:**
  - `int yearsOfService`
- **Constructor:**  
  `Assistant(int id, String name, int yearsOfService)`
- **Overrides:**
  - `displayInfo()` → prints ID, name, yearsOfService, and company name

---

## 4. Car (Independent Class)
- **Attributes:**
  - `int id`
  - `String model`
  - `boolean isAvailable`
  - `RentalCompany company`  
    (reference back to RentalCompany — "many → one" association)
- **Constructor:**  
  `Car(int id, String model, boolean isAvailable)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void setCompany(RentalCompany company)`
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    → prints ID, model, availability status, and company name if set

---

## 5. RentalCompany (Independent Class)

- **Attributes:**
  - `int id`
  - `String name`
  - `Worker[] workers`
  - `Car[] cars`
  - `int workerCount`
  - `int carCount`
- **Constructor:**  
  `RentalCompany(int id, String name, int workerCapacity, int carCapacity)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void addWorker(Worker w)`
    - Adds a worker (validate space)
    - Sets the worker's company reference
  - `void addCar(Car c)`
    - Adds a car (validate space)
    - Sets the car's company reference
  - `void displayWorkerInfo()`
    - Calls `displayInfo()` for each Worker
  - `void displayCarInfo()`
    - Calls `displayInfo()` for each Car
  - `void displayInfo()`
    - Prints company ID, name, worker and car counts
    - Separately displays all workers and all cars

# 🔥 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept                        | How it is used                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bi-Directional Association** | Workers and Cars have back-references to RentalCompany; RentalCompany holds arrays of Workers and Cars.     |
| **Inheritance**                | Manager and Assistant extend Worker.                                                                       |
| **Override**                   | Manager, Assistant, and Car override `displayInfo()`.                                                       |
| **Aggregation**                | RentalCompany aggregates Workers and Cars (they can exist outside if needed).                              |
| **Polymorphism**               | Arrays use Worker and Car references; method overriding allows runtime polymorphism for displayInfo().     |

# 🛠️ `public static void main(String[] args)`

1. Create a **RentalCompany** (e.g., "Speedy Rentals").
2. Create **Manager** and **Assistant** objects.
3. Create **Car** objects.
4. Add Workers and Cars to the company via `addWorker(...)` and `addCar(...)`.
5. Call `displayInfo()` on the RentalCompany.
