Create a **Hotel Booking System** where a `Guest` class maintains references to `Room` objects they have booked, and each `Room` maintains a reference back to the `Guest`.

Use **inheritance** where `Room` is a superclass and `DeluxeRoom`, `SuiteRoom` are subclasses.

**Requirements:**
- `Room` class: attributes `roomNumber` (String), `roomType` (String)
  - Constructor to initialize attributes
  - Method `displayRoomDetails()`
- `DeluxeRoom` class (inherits from `Room`): attribute `hasSeaView` (boolean)
- `SuiteRoom` class (inherits from `Room`): attribute `numberOfRooms` (int)

- `Guest` class:
  - Attributes: `guestID` (String), `guestName` (String)
  - A fixed-size array of `Room` objects (size 2)
  - Method `bookRoom(Room r)`
  - Method `displayGuestDetails()`

- `Room` class should also have:
  - Attribute `Guest guest` (to maintain back-reference)
  - Method `assignGuest(Guest g)`

- `HotelBookingApp` class (with `main` method):
  - Create instances of `DeluxeRoom` and `SuiteRoom`
  - Create a `Guest`
  - Assign rooms and guests mutually
  - Display all details
