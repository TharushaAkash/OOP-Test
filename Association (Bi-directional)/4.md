# üè• Story: Hospital Management System with Patient Cost Calculation

In a hospital, **Doctors** manage patients, and each doctor has a specialty with an associated cost. **Patients** are diagnosed and treated by doctors, and the treatment costs are calculated based on the doctor's specialty and the number of hours of treatment. The system needs a Java program that models this structure using **bi-directional association**, **inheritance**, **method overriding**, **aggregation**, and **dynamic updates** of patient treatment costs.

# üéØ Classes and Their Responsibilities

Design a Java program demonstrating **bi-directional association** between a **Hospital** and its **Doctor**, and between a **Hospital** and its **Patient**. The program must also showcase **inheritance**, **aggregation**, and **method overriding**.

---

## 1. **Person** (Base Class)

- **Attributes:**
  - `int id`
  - `String name`
- **Constructor:**  
  `Person(int id, String name)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    ‚Üí prints `id` and `name`.

---

## 2. **Doctor** (Subclass of Person)

- **Adds:**
  - `String specialty` (e.g., "Surgeon", "General Practitioner")
  - `double baseRate` (the base rate charged by the doctor depending on their specialty)
- **Constructor:**  
  `Doctor(int id, String name, String specialty, double baseRate)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void assignDepartment(Department department)`  
    ‚Üí assigns the doctor to a department.
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    ‚Üí prints `id`, `name`, `specialty`, and department‚Äôs name.
  - `double calculateTreatmentCost(int hours)`  
    ‚Üí calculates the treatment cost based on the number of hours of treatment and the doctor‚Äôs base rate.
    - The cost will be:  
      `treatmentCost = hours * baseRate`

---

## 3. **Patient** (Independent Class)

- **Adds:**
  - `int patientId`
  - `String diagnosis`
  - `Doctor assignedDoctor` (reference to the doctor assigned to the patient)
  - `int hoursOfTreatment` (the number of hours the patient receives treatment)
- **Constructor:**  
  `Patient(int patientId, String diagnosis, int hoursOfTreatment)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void assignDoctor(Doctor doctor)`  
    ‚Üí assigns the patient to a doctor.
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    ‚Üí prints patient details (patient ID, diagnosis, doctor's name, and treatment hours).
  - `double calculatePatientCost()`  
    ‚Üí calls `assignedDoctor.calculateTreatmentCost(hoursOfTreatment)` to calculate the treatment cost based on the doctor's rate and the treatment hours.

---

## 4. **Department** (Independent Class)

- **Adds:**
  - `int departmentId`
  - `String departmentName`
  - `Doctor[] doctors` (Holds doctors assigned to the department)
- **Constructor:**  
  `Department(int departmentId, String departmentName, int doctorCapacity)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void addDoctor(Doctor doctor)`  
    ‚Üí Adds a doctor to the department.
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    ‚Üí Prints the department name and list of doctors.

---

## 5. **Hospital** (Independent Class)

- **Adds:**
  - `int hospitalId`
  - `String name`
  - `Department[] departments`
  - `int departmentCount`
- **Constructor:**  
  `Hospital(int hospitalId, String name, int departmentCapacity)`
- **Methods:**
  - `void addDepartment(Department department)`  
    ‚Üí adds a department to the hospital (validate capacity).
  - `void displayInfo()`  
    ‚Üí prints hospital details (ID and name) and lists all departments.
  - `void assignPatientToDoctor(Patient patient, Doctor doctor)`  
    ‚Üí assigns a patient to a specific doctor and updates both the doctor‚Äôs and patient‚Äôs records.
  - `void assignDoctorToDepartment(Doctor doctor, Department department)`  
    ‚Üí assigns a doctor to a department (if not already assigned).

# üî• OOP Concepts Used

| Concept                        | How it is used                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bi-Directional Association** | Hospital holds arrays of Departments and Doctors; Department holds an array of Doctors; each Doctor and Patient is linked. |
| **Inheritance**                | Doctor extends Person.                                                                                      |
| **Override**                   | Doctor overrides `displayInfo()` to include specialty and department information.                           |
| **Aggregation**                | Hospital aggregates Departments and Doctors (they can exist outside the hospital).                         |
| **Polymorphism**               | Methods such as `assignPatientToDoctor()` handle objects in a way that allows the correct method behavior based on dynamic data. |

# üõ†Ô∏è `public static void main(String[] args)`

1. Create a **Hospital**.
2. Create **Doctor** objects and assign them to **Departments**.
3. Create **Patient** objects and assign them to **Doctors**.
4. Use **assignPatientToDoctor()** and **assignDoctorToDepartment()** methods to handle relationships between **Patients**, **Doctors**, and **Departments**.
5. Call `displayInfo()` on the **Hospital** to display its details, including departments, doctors, and patient assignments.
6. Call `calculatePatientCost()` on the **Patient** to calculate and display the treatment cost.

- Display hospital details.
- List all departments with the doctors in each department.
- Display the doctors with their specialties and assigned departments.
- List patients and their assigned doctor names.
