## üìö Story: Library Management System

In library, different types of workers like Librarians and Assistants manage daily operations. Library also manages a collection of **Books**.  
The system needs a Java program that models this structure using **bi-directional association**, **inheritance**, and **method overriding** to track both **workers** and **books**.

---

## üéØ Classes and Their Responsibilities

Design a Java program that demonstrates **bi-directional association** between a **Library** and its **Worker**, as well as between a **Library** and its **Book**, along with basic **inheritance** and **method overriding**.

---

### 1. Worker (Base Class)
- **Attributes:**
  - int id
  - String name
  - Library library  
    (reference back to the Library‚Äî‚Äúmany ‚Üí one‚Äù side of the association)
- **Constructor:**  
  Worker(int id, String name)
- **Methods:**
  - void setLibrary(Library lib)  
    ‚Üí assigns the library field
  - void displayInfo()  
    ‚Üí to be *overridden* by subclasses; should also print the library‚Äôs name if set

---

### 2. Librarian (Subclass of Worker)
- **Adds:**
  - int yearsOfExperience
- **Constructor:**  
  Librarian(int id, String name, int yearsOfExperience)
- **Overrides:**
  - displayInfo() ‚Üí prints id, name, yearsOfExperience **and** the name of the library

---

### 3. Assistant (Subclass of Worker)
- **Adds:**
  - int shiftLength
  - boolean isCertified
- **Constructor:**  
  Assistant(int id, String name, int shiftLength, boolean isCertified)
- **Overrides:**
  - displayInfo() ‚Üí prints id, name, shiftLength, certification status **and** the name of the library

---

### 4. Book (Independent Class)
- **Attributes:**
  - int id
  - String title
  - String author
  - Library library  
    (reference back to the Library‚Äî‚Äúmany ‚Üí one‚Äù association)

- **Constructor:**  
  Book(int id, String title, String author)

- **Methods:**
  - void setLibrary(Library lib)  
    ‚Üí assigns the library field
  - void displayInfo()  
    ‚Üí prints id, title, author, and library name if set

---

### 5. Library (Independent Class)

- **Attributes:**
  - `int id` ‚Äî Library ID
  - `String name` ‚Äî Library name
  - `Worker[] workers` ‚Äî Array holding Librarian and Assistant instances (one-to-many relationship)
  - `int workerCount` ‚Äî Current number of workers
  - `Book[] books` ‚Äî Array holding Book instances (one-to-many relationship)
  - `int bookCount` ‚Äî Current number of books

- **Constructor:**
  - `Library(int id, String name, int workerCapacity, int bookCapacity)`
    - Initializes the library with given ID, name, and capacities for workers and books.

- **Methods:**
  - `void addWorker(Worker w)`
    - Adds a new worker.
    - Validates if there is space available (based on `workerCapacity`).
  
  - `void addBook(Book b)`
    - Adds a new book.
    - Validates if there is space available (based on `bookCapacity`).

  - `void displayWorkerInfo()`
    - Invokes `displayInfo()` on each Worker instance.

  - `void displayBookInfo()`
    - Invokes `displayInfo()` on each Book instance.

  - `void displayInfo()`
    - Prints:
      - Library ID and name
      - Current worker count
      - Current book count
    - Then:
      - Displays all workers' information separately (by calling `displayWorkerInfo()`)
      - Displays all books' information separately (by calling `displayBookInfo()`)

## üî• OOP Concepts Used

| Concept                        | How it is used                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bi-Directional Association** | Library holds a list of Workers and Books; each Worker and Book has a reference back to its Library.             |
| **Inheritance**                | Librarian and Assistant extend Worker.                                                                          |
| **Override**                   | Librarian, Assistant, and Book override displayInfo() to include specific details and library name.              |
| **Polymorphism**               | addWorker(Worker w) and addBook(Book b) accept any subclass; calls to displayInfo() invoke the correct override at runtime. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è public static void main(String[] args)
1. Create a **Library** (e.g., "Fiction" or "Research").
2. Create several **Librarian** and **Assistant** objects.
3. Create several **Book** objects.
4. Add each Worker and Book to the Library via `addWorker(...)` and `addBook(...)`.
5. Call `displayInfo()` in library to show all details.
