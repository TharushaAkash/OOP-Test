### Question 04

Develop a **Student-Course Registration System** implementing a **unidirectional association** where:
- The `Student` class maintains references to courses they have enrolled in
- The `Course` class does **not** store any reference to students

---


#### Course Class Specifications
The `Course` class represents a university course with the following requirements:

**Attributes:**
- `courseCode` (String) - Course identifier
- `courseTitle` (String) - Course name

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize course attributes upon object creation
- `displayCourseDetails()` - Print course code and title to console

---

#### Student Class Specifications
The `Student` class models a student who can enroll in up to **three courses**.

**Attributes:**
- `studentID` (String) - Student identifier
- `studentName` (String) - Student's full name
- `enrolledCourses[]` (Course array) - Fixed-size array to store enrolled courses (size = 3)
- `courseCount` (int) - Track number of currently enrolled courses

**Methods:**
- **Default Constructor** - Initialize with empty course array
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize student details
- `enrollCourse(Course course)` - Add course to array (only if `courseCount < 3`) if not show an error message.
- `displayStudentDetails()` - Print student information and all enrolled course details

---


### Implement the Main Class

- Create at least 3 Course objects with different details
- Create 1 Student object using parameterized constructor
- Use enrollCourse() to enroll student in all 3 courses
- Call displayStudentDetails() to show final output


---

## Main Method Requirements

1. **Create Course Objects**
   - Instantiate three `Course` objects with unique codes and titles

2. **Create Student Object**
   - Use parameterized constructor to initialize student details

3. **Enroll Student**
   - Use `enrollCourse()` method to enroll the student in all three courses

4. **Display Results**
   - Call `displayStudentDetails()` to print complete student information and enrolled courses

---

## Expected Output Format

The system should display:
- Student ID and Name
- Number of enrolled courses
- Details of each enrolled course (using `displayCourseDetails()` method)
