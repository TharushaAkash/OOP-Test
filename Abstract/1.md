### ðŸŽ¯ Java Abstraction Coding Question

Create an abstract class called `Employee` with the following:

- A protected field: `name`
- A constructor to set the name
- An abstract method: `calculateSalary()`
- A method `display()` to print the employee's name

Then, create two subclasses:
- `FullTimeEmployee` â€“ with a monthly salary field
   -  private double monthlySalary;
   -  `double calculateSalary()` -> monthlySalary
- `PartTimeEmployee` â€“ with hours worked and hourly rate
   -  private int hoursWorked;
   -  private double hourlyRate;
   -  `double calculateSalary()` -> hoursWorked * hourlyRate
Each subclass should implement `calculateSalary()` differently.

Finally, in the `Main` class, create and display salary information for one full-time and one part-time employee using abstraction.

**Hint:** Use the `abstract` keyword and remember that you cannot instantiate abstract classes directly.
