### Write a program that prompts the user to enter their **name** and **age**, then validates both inputs using two custom exception classes.

**Custom Exception Classes:**

â€¢ **InvalidNameException** â€“ is an exception class that prints the error message `"Name must not be empty"` if the user does not enter a name (empty string or just spaces).

â€¢ **InvalidAgeException** â€“ is an exception class that prints the error message `"Age must be between 1 and 120"` if the user enters an age that is less than 1 or greater than 120.

**Main Application Class:**

Create a class called **UserInfoApp** that asks the user to enter their name and age, and then validates the inputs using the above two rules.

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

Use appropriate `try-catch` blocks to handle the exceptions. Show all relevant error messages if any input is invalid.
