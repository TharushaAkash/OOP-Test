### ‚ùì Question: Can You Use a Custom Exception to Validate Age When Creating a Student?

You are building a Java program that includes:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Custom exception handling
- Age validation using a custom exception thrown inside the constructor

---

### üßæ Task Instructions:

1. **Create a class named `InvalidAgeException`** that extends `Exception`.  
   - It should take a message in the constructor and pass it to the superclass.

2. **Create a `Student` class** with the following fields:
   - `int id`
   - `String name`
   - `int age`

3. In the `Student` **constructor**, do the following:
   - Validate the `age`.  
   - If the age is **less than 5** or **greater than 100**, **throw `InvalidAgeException`** with a suitable message (e.g., `"Invalid age: must be between 5 and 100"`).

4. In the `main()` method:
   - Ask the user to enter details for a student (id, name, age).
   - Use a `try-catch` block to catch the `InvalidAgeException`.
   - If the exception is caught, display the message `"InvalidAgeException: "` followed by the error message.
