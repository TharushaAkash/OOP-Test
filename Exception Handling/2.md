## Write a program that prompts the user to enter their **username** and **password**, then performs the following validations using two different custom exception classes:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

â€¢ **InvalidUsernameException** â€“ is an exception class that prints the error message `"Username must be at least 5 characters long"` if the username is shorter than 5 characters.

â€¢ **InvalidPasswordException** â€“ is an exception class that prints the error message `"Password must be at least 6 characters long"` if the password is shorter than 6 characters.

**Main Application Class:**

Create a class called **UserValidationApp** that asks the user to enter a username and password, and then validates the inputs using the above two rules.

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

Use appropriate `try-catch` blocks to handle one or both exceptions. Show the error message if validation fails.
